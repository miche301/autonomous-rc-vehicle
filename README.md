# autonomous-rc-vehicle
This repository contains the embedded and application-level code used in an autonomous RC vehicle project. A Raspberry Pi handles high-level perception and control logic, while a Raspberry Pi Pico is used for real-time motor control and PWM generation.

Full project overview, hardware design, and testing details are documented in the project portfolio.
