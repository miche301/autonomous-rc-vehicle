# autonomous-rc-vehicle
This repository documents my role in a collaborative autonomous RC vehicle project developed as part of an undergraduate engineering course. 

The system uses a Raspberry Pi for high-level perception and navigation and a Raspberry Pi Pico for real-time motor control and hardware interfacing. A custom motor control PCB was designed and validated to support reliable autonomous operation.

My contributions included:
-Motor control PCB schematic and layout design (Altium Designer)
-Raspberry Pi Pico firmware for deterministic PWM motor control
-Hardware–software integration between the Pi, Pico, and motor driver
-Pre-power bring-up, validation using a digital multimeter and oscilloscope, and system debugging
